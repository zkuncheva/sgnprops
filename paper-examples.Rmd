## R Markdown

This document walks the reader through the codes needed to reproduce the example presented in the paper. It takes advantage of the underlying SGNprops package build for this purpose. 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
